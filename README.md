BeadSorted.Saliva.EPIC

The **BeadSorted.Saliva.EPIC** data package contains publically available Illumina human methylation data from EPIC saliva samples assayed by Middleton and colleagues (manuscript submitted). It includes an RGChannelSet, a comparison table with degree of association between cell type and samples, and cell proportion estimates within our samples as calculated by the ewastools implementation of the Houseman algorithm. This dataset is novel for cell proportion estimations in saliva and may be useful to end users for estimating and controlling for cell-type heterogeneity in their study samples.

For the purposes of consistency and convenience to the end user, this package is heavily based upon similar packages, including the **FlowSorted.Blood.EPIC** package.
